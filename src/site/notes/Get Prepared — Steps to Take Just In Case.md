- ICE cannot enter a private business without a signed warrant. You have similar rights as you would have in your home. 
- **Even outdoor / ambiguously-defined work sites, such as construction sites, can be marked as private workplace.** To do so, employers can: 
	- Put up “Private Worksite — Authorized Personnel Only” signs.
	- Use cones, caution tape, or portable fencing to clearly mark the boundary.
	- Have a policy that all visitors must check in at the office or trailer.
	- Train foremen/supervisors to:
		- Ask ICE: “Do you have a judicial warrant signed by a judge?”
		- **Read the warrant.**
		- **If it’s administrative (I-200/I-205): “This does not give you permission to enter. I do not consent.”**
