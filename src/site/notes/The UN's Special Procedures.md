# The UN's Special Procedures
- Special procedures are one mechanism by which [[the United Nations\|the United Nations]] is able to enforce [[international human rights\|international human rights]] ([Source](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/Res/dhr_training_manual_2017%203.pdf), p. 21). 
- "Special procedures usually have the power to examine, monitor, and publicly report on human rights situations in specific locations (known as country mandates) or on major human rights issues worldwide (known as thematic mandates)" ([Source](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/Res/dhr_training_manual_2017%203.pdf), p. 21) 
	- Civil organizations or individuals within countries can submit **complaints** ([Source](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/Res/dhr_training_manual_2017%203.pdf), p. 21). 
		- "The Complain procedure is a confidential, victims-oriented mechanism established to allow the Human Rights Council to address consistent patterns of gross human rights violations" ([Source](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/Res/dhr_training_manual_2017%203.pdf), p. 21) 
		- "After receiving the complaint ('communication') from an individual or group claiming to be a victim or having direct knowledge of a human rights violation, the Working Group on Communications assesses the admissibility and merits of the communication and then passes it on to the Working Group on Situations, which determines whether there is a pattern of gross human rights violations, considers the country's reply, and presents a report and recommendations for action to the full Human Rights Council"  ([Source](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/Res/dhr_training_manual_2017%203.pdf), p. 21) 
		- The HRC will not accept complaints unless domestic remedies have been exhausted (except when remedies would be ineffective or unreasonably prolonged) or if another international or regional human rights complaint mechanism is considering the issue" ([Source](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/Res/dhr_training_manual_2017%203.pdf), p. 21)
