Lots of ICE in your community? Watching recent events unfold from afar? I frequently feel paralyzed, overwhelmed, and powerless — in other words, **frozen**. Education, motivation, and actionable tasks are all crucial for getting oneself unfrozen, and the more of us there are bringing the heat, the easier it is to melt the ICE. Every drop counts.

This archive collects & regularly updates vetted resources useful for melting the ICE, including direct calls-to-action (organized according to financial or geographical requirements), inspiration stories or materials, and learning materials. **We're not all financially able to donate or physically able to protest, but there is something everyone can do right now.** Fascism thrives on disorganization, ignorance, and overwhelm. **Community connection and action are the enemies of fascism.** This archive is updated **daily.**
