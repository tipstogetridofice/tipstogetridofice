# How to Keep Yourself Safe 

> *What you do can challenge the interests of powerful actors and this can put you at great risk. The more effective your work is, the more likely it is that this will put you at risk.*
> — *Security Workbook, Frontline Defenders ([Source](https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/sites/default/files/workbook_eng_master.pdf))*
## General Info & Guidelines 
- **Keep a mental 'map' of where your friends, sympathizers, and allies are. If you sense you are in danger, make your way to the nearest safe location.** ([Source](https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/sites/default/files/workbook_eng_master.pdf))
	- This can be friends, family, shops, religious institutions, even police (if the police are not those creating the danger). 
- **Keep calm.**
- **Keep your mobile phone on you, charged, and emergency contact numbers saved.**
## Physical Safety 
- **Have an alert system.** This may be a high-tech security system, but doesn't have to be — a loud dog, neighborhood whistles, a Signal group chat, and more might be appropriate alert systems ([source](https://securityinabox.org/en/assess-plan/physical-security/)). 
- **Get to know your neighbors.** Determine whether they are allies or potential threats ([source](https://securityinabox.org/en/assess-plan/physical-security/)). 
- **Create an emergency plan** with your family, your workplace, and other communities you regularly visit. **See [[Get Prepared — Steps to Take Just In Case\|preparation guides]] for resources & suggestions.** 
- Public wifi networks should be considered insecure. 
- Physically protect your devices by keeping them within sight, purchasing a security cable, etc ([source](https://securityinabox.org/en/assess-plan/physical-security/)). 
	- See [[Digital Protection Measures\|Digital Protection Measures]] for how to set up safety procedures on your devices. 
- Establish a **clean desk policy** — be careful about what resources are lying around and visible ([source](https://securityinabox.org/en/assess-plan/physical-security/)). 
- Purchase privacy screens (plastic covers that reduce who can look over your shoulder when using a device in public) ([source](https://securityinabox.org/en/assess-plan/physical-security/)). 
- Regularly destroy sensitive information stored in your physical and digital files ([source](https://securityinabox.org/en/assess-plan/physical-security/)).
