# The UN's Periodic Reporting Process 
- "Advocates and activists can provide the United Nations with specific, credible reports of human rights violations or lack of progress on human rights issues by submitting a report that 'shadows' the issues addressed in the government's report" ([Source](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/Res/dhr_training_manual_2017%203.pdf), p. 22) 
	- "Shadow reports are considered along with the government's report to the treaty body and highlight problems that the government may have overlooked or wanted to exclude" ([Source](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/Res/dhr_training_manual_2017%203.pdf), p. 22) 
- "Currently, the United States is obligated to report on human rights compliance under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and the Convention against Torture" ([Source](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/Res/dhr_training_manual_2017%203.pdf), p. 22). 
- **You can [[File a shadow report\|File a shadow report]] with the UN**. 
	- "For example, when reporting violations of immigrants' rights in the United States to the Human Rights Committee, reference should be made to Article 13 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which discusses the rigths of aliens. When preparing a submission, there is no obligation to assess complaince under every article of a treaty; rather, it is best for advocates to focus on areas within their expertise where there is evidence of a particular violation" ([Source](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/Res/dhr_training_manual_2017%203.pdf), p. 22)
