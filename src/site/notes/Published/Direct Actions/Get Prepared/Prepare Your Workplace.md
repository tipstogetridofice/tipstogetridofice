# Make Your Workplace Safe 
- Put up “Private Worksite — Authorized Personnel Only” signs.
- Use cones, caution tape, or portable fencing to clearly mark the boundary.
- Have a policy that all visitors must check in at the office or trailer.
- Train foremen/supervisors to:
- Ask ICE: “Do you have a judicial warrant signed by a judge?”
	- **Read the warrant.**
	- **If it’s administrative (I-200/I-205): “This does not give you permission to enter. I do not consent.”**
