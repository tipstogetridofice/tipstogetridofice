# Educational Materials 
Perhaps you don't have the time, energy, or bandwidth for direct action right now. **Fascism thrives on ignorance and apathy.** Get smart, study your history, and learn how to care for yourself and your community. **If you can't fight the monster, tend the garden.** 

Below you can find materials to read, watch, or listen to that discuss history (to learn from), current politics and activism (to stay informed), self and community care (this is a marathon, not  a sprint), and hopeful visions of the future (so that we can build a better world). 

Want to contribute in other ways? ⬅️ Return to the [[Published/Throw Salt — Direct Action/Direct Actions\|Masterlist of Direct Actions to take NOW]].
Unable to take direct action right now? Turn up the heat with some [[Published/Get Heated, Become Inspired\|inspiration]].

## **Community Policing Agreements** 
- Central Minnesota's FYJ worked to craft Community Policing Agreements between local police departments and members of the community. 
	- [This anonymous Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k6HWBjQt4Os9f0n0eEc3hsy-PIO3XDK4)  contains examples of what these agreements look like (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k6HWBjQt4Os9f0n0eEc3hsy-PIO3XDK4).
