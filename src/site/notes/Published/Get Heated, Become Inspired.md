## Historic Victories, Recent Wins, Quotes to inspire a Better Future 

### Over $150,000 donated to Cavalry Food Shelf to help those threatened by ICE. 
"**Fear is keeping families from food.** Our neighbors are living under constant threat and the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent just blocks from our food shelf has shattered any sense of safety. People are afraid to leave their homes. They can't go to work, can't pick up groceries, and can't access the resources they need.

At the same time, the Trump administration has frozen federal SNAP benefits for nearly 454,000 Minnesotans, cutting off over $129 million in food assistance. As federal support vanishes and ICE enforcement continues, local action is critical."
**$166,476 raised, and counting** — as of 1/30/2026.
