If you aren't physically able to contribute at this time, **your money and attention are your biggest sources of power.** Modern autocrats rely on overwhelming wealth to back their power. If we all come together and each contribute even only a few dollars, we can counter them. 

*While one-time donations are amazing, they tend to be subject to the whims of the news cycle. **Monthly donations**, if you can spare it, provide **consistent support.***
