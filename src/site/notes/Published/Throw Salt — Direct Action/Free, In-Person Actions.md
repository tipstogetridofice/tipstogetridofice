If you aren't physically or financially able to contribute at this time, then your time and attention is best put towards **organizing, sharing, and managing digital resources and information.** Fascism thrives on ignorance, apathy, and falsehood, so keep track of knowledge, caring for others, and empowering truthful messages goes a long way towards confronting it.
