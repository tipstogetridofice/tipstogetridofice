# A Direct Action Masterlist 
Direct action is the bread and butter of resistance, but oftentimes it can feel intimidating, overwhelming, or confusing. Outlined below, you can find **tasks you can do *right now*** (or in the near future) that will directly contribute to those working on the front lines. Tasks are organized by whether they are free or paid, in-person or online, or an event you can attend. 

This page is updated at least weekly.
