# Educational Materials 
Perhaps you don't have the time, energy, or bandwidth for direct action right now. **Fascism thrives on ignorance and apathy.** Get smart, study your history, and learn how to care for yourself and your community. **If you can't fight the monster, tend the garden.** 

Below you can find materials to read, watch, or listen to that discuss history (to learn from), current politics and activism (to stay informed), self and community care (this is a marathon, not  a sprint), and hopeful visions of the future (so that we can build a better world).
