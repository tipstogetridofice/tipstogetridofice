### Helping a Detainee 
- A detained US Citizen: US citizens are typically processed separately from those of different immigration status — most often, they are **released within a few hours.** Calling the NLG hotline is still recommended: **612-444-2654** ([source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0))
- A detained Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR): loved ones should immediately complete the Habeas Project intake form, which mobilizes lawyers, legal workers, and law students to file habeas petitions quickly. ([source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0))
- Detainees of other immigrant statuses: Call the National Lawyers Guilde hotline **612-444-2654** and file a **habeas petition** ([source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0)). 
- **Call this network of volunteer attorneys.** They’ve set up a hotline for loved ones to call, ideally as soon as people are abducted, to provide us with the info we need (the detained individual’s full name, DOB, A number (if applicable), etc.). The faster they can connect with loved ones after an abduction, the better. They have an intake team and interpreters who will get back to people as soon as possible. **The number is 1-833-511-4766** ([source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0)).
