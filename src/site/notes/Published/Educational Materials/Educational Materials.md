> **The safest community is a community that is educated and organized. You are not alone!**
> *—Community Justice Exchange*

We need to build a better future, and prevent this from ever happening again. Get smart, study your history, and learn how to care for yourself and your community. **If you can't fight the monster, tend the garden.**
