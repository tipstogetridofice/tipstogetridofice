# Educational Materials 
Not everyone is physically able to attend protests or financially able to support organizations — but there's still more you can do. We need to build a better future, and prevent this from ever happening again. Get smart, study your history, and learn how to care for yourself and your community. **If you can't fight the monster, tend the garden.**
