# Educational Materials 
Not everyone is physically able to attend protests or financially able to support organizations — but there's still more you can do. We need to build a better future, and prevent this from ever happening again. Get smart, study your history, and learn how to care for yourself and your community. **If you can't fight the monster, tend the garden.**

## Questions to Ask Yourself
- Who is in charge of your county? 
	- ICE officers sometimes sign agreements with local law enforcement at the county level. Educate yourself on how your county is run, and by whom. ([source](https://www.ice.gov/identify-and-arrest/287g))
## Your to-read, watch, and listen list 
- [*Five Questions for Cultivating Solidarity When Responding to Political Repression*](https://www.communityjusticeexchange.org/en/resources-all/five-questions-for-cultivating-solidarity): In a time of heightened mobilization, like now, law enforcement systems ratchet up repression and deploy legal categories to undermine our movements by singling out particular groups and tactics for criminalization. Universities and colleges collaborate with law enforcement to target and isolate student activists. It is essential that we show solidarity right now and resist their predictable attempts to divide-and-conquer. *This document is an invitation, not a set of instructions.* As organizers and writers who have fallen into the anti-solidarity traps described in the resource, we invite anyone commenting or reporting on political repression to consider the questions we offer. (https://www.communityjusticeexchange.org/en/resources-all/five-questions-for-cultivating-solidarity) 
## Models, Templates, How-tos, etc
