# History & Present Moment: ICE
([source](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/02/nx-s1-5686396/ice-arrest-refugees-legal-minneapolis-minnesota-immigration?utm_campaign=npr&utm_source=bsky.app&utm_term=nprnews&utm_medium=social)) (([source 2](https://refugeerights.org/news-resources/court-orders-ice-to-stop-unlawful-arrest-and-detention-of-refugees))
### Background on ICE 
- The Trump Administration has implemented a policy instructing ICE to go door-to-door and detain immigrants — even those holding lawful immigration statuses, such as refugee status — as part of a bureaucratic excuse that they are "reviewing" immigration cases from recent years ([source](https://refugeerights.org/news-resources/court-orders-ice-to-stop-unlawful-arrest-and-detention-of-refugees)). **This is clearly an excuse, and the exact kind of excuse routinely used by fascists to remove dissidents.**
- As a result, ICE is currently ([source](https://refugeerights.org/news-resources/court-orders-ice-to-stop-unlawful-arrest-and-detention-of-refugees)): 
	- Targeting those awarded refugee status 
	- Going door-to-door, particularly in Minnesota 
	- **Arresting, trafficking, and detaining refugees (incl. the elderly and children) in inhumane conditions in detention camps in Texas** 
	- Sending those released from detention out onto the streets of Texas with no support, money, identification, or transportation home. 
- **This is unlawful. Legal advocacy groups are doing the hard work of pushing through class action lawsuits pushing back against these policies.**
- ICE officers sometimes sign agreements with local law enforcement at the county level. Educate yourself on how your county is run, and by whom. ([source](https://www.ice.gov/identify-and-arrest/287g))
- ICE has a history subjecting immigrants to "[digital prisons](https://www.communityjusticeexchange.org/en/resources-all/fact-sheet-on-ice-foia-lawsuit)" and [surveillance](https://www.communityjusticeexchange.org/en/resources-all/trackedamp-trapped-experiences-from-ice-digital-prisons) that effects lasting trauma and harm ([source 1](https://www.communityjusticeexchange.org/en/resources-all/fact-sheet-on-ice-foia-lawsuit))([source 2](https://www.communityjusticeexchange.org/en/resources-all/trackedamp-trapped-experiences-from-ice-digital-prisons))
### Am I being targeted? Risk Factors & Warning Signs 
[source 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBCNIw1ISuc6OCT2A2FDcU_A_T7lXC378E_kyuVDk0c/edit?tab=t.r5votdo95gm)
- If you receive unexpected calls asking you to report to your case manager, set up / attend unexpected appointments, or telling you that you are being removed and need to organize your departure, etc. 
- If your case ends / you've exhausted all possibilities in your case. 
- If you are being surveilled by ICE and receive a notification that your surveillance technology is broken and needs to be fixed.
- If you are out on bond and the person/organization that posted your bond receives something called a “Notice to Deliver Alien.”
- **If you have a final and enforceable order of deportation/removal.** 
	- Even if an immigration judge has ordered your removal, that removal order is NOT final and enforceable IF you have an appeal pending OR you otherwise have a valid order from the immigration court system or from a federal court that forbids ICE from removing you.) 
	- NOTE: So far, this seems to be the most common risk factor that has been reported in recent arrests of people under ICE surveillance.
- If you have new contact with law enforcement or the criminal justice system. 
- If you have **ever** missed immigration court (no matter the reason) and/or if you failed to meet any of the requirements of your supervision program and/or if you have not met any of ICE's demands at any point. 
		- This includes working without authorization if prohibited by your surveillance program. 
### Lying & Trickery: ICE's tactics 
> "His wife grabbed documents to show they and their four children are lawful refugees from Venezuela.
   'They told me they just needed to verify the fingerprints for our oldest son, but he would not be detained,' he said. The family asked to use only their initials for fear of retaliation from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
   J.J. and his wife, A., didn't understand why one child's fingerprints would need checking, but they opened the door. And then they watched as their 20-year-old son was, in fact, arrested and driven away in a black SUV.
   'When I saw him being handcuffed, I felt so scared,' A. said. '**They were treating him like a delinquent. And they had guns with their fingers on the trigger.**

#### Here's what to look for 
- **In Minnesota** 
	- Asylees and refugees—including those with pending AOS applications—are being sent letters instructing them to report to Fort Snelling for a “check-in,” often without stating the reason. **These appointments can result in sudden detention.** ([source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0))
- Examples of trickery ([source 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBCNIw1ISuc6OCT2A2FDcU_A_T7lXC378E_kyuVDk0c/edit?tab=t.r5votdo95gm)) ([source 2](https://www.npr.org/2026/02/02/nx-s1-5686396/ice-arrest-refugees-legal-minneapolis-minnesota-immigration?utm_campaign=npr&utm_source=bsky.app&utm_term=nprnews&utm_medium=social))
	- telling someone to come get their ankle shackle removed at an ICE or ISAP office 
	- telling someone something was wrong with their technology and it needed to be fixed ASAP at an ICE or ISAP office 
	- remotely activating someone’s ankle monitor alarm then waiting outside a residence or community spaces to detain them
	- asking people to come in for appointments on dates other than their typical check-ins
	- telling someone they need to come in to an ICE office to get their fingerprints taken
	- asking people to step outside of a building to take a photo of their location then detain them 
	- asking people to come in to an ICE office to verify or change their address
## Your Threat Level based on your Immigration Status
### General Recommendations 
[source 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBCNIw1ISuc6OCT2A2FDcU_A_T7lXC378E_kyuVDk0c/edit?tab=t.r5votdo95gm)
- **If you sense that you are in trouble, trust your gut.** Call your support team or a trusted organization that can be ready to assist you
- **Document all interactions with ICE**, including your attempt to reschedule missed appointments. 
- Create a Safety Plan & establish a safe place to go. 
- **Ascertain your exact immigration status.** You can call this toll-free number to learn some basic information about your case: (**800-898-7180**). Please note that the information provided is not always reliable! 
	- (Common examples of case status leading to increased risk include: you have deportation order and no more appeals left; you have a stay of removal that is about to expire; your case was closed but you still check-in with ICE?)
- Contact a local community organization for support with safety planning and support with check-ins. Some organizations will offer to go with you to a check-in. Let the organization know about your appointment as soon as possible, as this increases the likelihood they will be able to help.
		- Use this [directory](https://www.detentionwatchnetwork.org/about/membership-directory) to find community organizations who can help. 
### I have refugee status
- Read [IRAP (the International Refugee Assistance Project)'s comprehensive online resource](https://support.iraplegalinfo.org/hc/en-us/articles/43974720166420-I-live-in-the-US-and-I-have-refugee-status-What-should-I-know) detailing your rights and how you can best prepare yourself. 
	- Link: https://support.iraplegalinfo.org/hc/en-us/articles/43974720166420-I-live-in-the-US-and-I-have-refugee-status-What-should-I-know
- Anyone with asylum or refugee status (with or without pending AOS) should have a habeas petition prepared in advance, ready to be filed immediately if ICE detains them. Families should also identify a Next Friend in advance in case the detained person cannot communicate or access the courts. ([source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0))
- If you notice any errors or unexpected changes, it may be the result of a system error — **contact your case manager immediately.**
- If you have a scheduled check-in with an immigration official, **do not show up alone**; always bring someone (example: someone with US citizenship status) who is not at risk of being arrested by ICE.
#### As part of my immigration status, I am in a surveillance program run by ICE 
- Community Justice Exchange's [WHEN ICE IS WATCHING](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bBCNIw1ISuc6OCT2A2FDcU_A_T7lXC378E_kyuVDk0c/edit?tab=t.r5votdo95gm) explains some red flags to look out for and safety measures to take if you are under digital surveillance as part of your supervision program. 
- Discuss potential risks and protective actions with an attorney before checking in with ICE and/or BI. Ask them to help you exit the program ([de-escalate](https://resources.humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ATD-Attorney-Guide-3.pdf)) or reduce your participation with these programs. If you don’t have an attorney, you can use this [directory](https://www.immigrationadvocates.org/legaldirectory/) to try to find free legal representation.
		- **If you have any pending criminal charges or investigations,** talk to an attorney about resentencing, pardons, etc. 
		- If you don't have an attorney, get one. See the section on [[Published/In need of help? Click here.\|legal services]].

	- If you don't have an attorney, get one. See the section on [[Published/In need of help? Click here.\|legal services]]. 
## Parental Rights & ICE 
- Read the [Center for Law and Social Policy's document](https://www.clasp.org/publications/fact-sheet/know-your-rights-parents-detained-by-ice/) on what parents detained by ICE need to know. (https://www.clasp.org/publications/fact-sheet/know-your-rights-parents-detained-by-ice/). Central takeaways: 
	- You have the right to make decisions about the care and custody of your child at the time of arrest.
	- You have the right to be kept near your child and stay in touch with them while detained.
	- You can ask for help in most detention centers to help you make plans for your children.
	- You can be part of your child’s welfare court case while you are in ICE detention.
	- You can decide whether your child will remain in the U.S. and make alternative  care arrangements.
## If ICE Stops Your Vehicle 
[Source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9q47kmni28om) [En Español](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9q47kmni28om)
ICE can approach people in or around cars, but your rights still apply.
- You do NOT have to answer questions about immigration status, citizenship, or place of birth.
- You do NOT have to consent to a search of your car.  
    Say: “I do not consent to a search.”
- Keep your hands visible and stay calm.
- If you are a passenger, you can remain silent and ask if you are free to leave.
- If ICE detains you:  
	- Remain silent.  
	- Do not sign anything.  
	- Ask for a lawyer.
- Police can ask for a driver’s license and registration.
	- ICE cannot issue traffic tickets or arrest you for driving violations.
	- Do NOT lie or show false documents.
