### Prior to being Detained 
- ➡️ [[Published/Educational Materials/Know Your Rights\|Know Your Rights]]
- **In Minnesota** 
	- Asylees and refugees—including those with pending AOS applications—are being sent letters instructing them to report to Fort Snelling for a “check-in,” often without stating the reason. **These appointments can result in sudden detention.** ([source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0))
	- Anyone with asylum or refugee status (with or without pending AOS) should have a habeas petition prepared in advance, ready to be filed immediately if ICE detains them. Families should also identify a Next Friend in advance in case the detained person cannot communicate or access the courts. ([source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0))
### Immediately Following Detention 
- What happens? 
	- US citizens are typically processed separately from those of different immigration status — most often, they are **released within a few hours.** Calling the NLG hotline is still recommended: **612-444-2654** ([source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0))
	- For Lawful Permanent Residents (LPRs), loved ones should immediately complete the Habeas Project intake form, which mobilizes lawyers, legal workers, and law students to file habeas petitions quickly. ([source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0))
- **In Minnesota** 
	- **Call the NLG Hotline 612-444-2654**
	- If someone has just been detained by ICE and has not yet been transferred to Whipple or out of Minnesota, there is a narrow window to act. **Whether a family member, Next Friend, or attorney is contacted first, the following information should be gathered as quickly as possible to allow immediate habeas filing ([source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0)):**
		- Full legal name
		- Date of birth
		- Alien number (A-Number), if known
		- Immigration history (especially confirmation of no final removal order)
		- City of residence in Minnesota
		- Location, date, and time of arrest
		- Current detention location (if known) — for example, local holding facility, Whipple, or ICE processing site
		- Phone number of a family member or trusted contact
		- Name and status (U.S. citizen or LPR) of the Next Friend
	- This information **allows a habeas petition to be filed immediately,** even if an attorney is not yet involved. If the A-Number or detention location is unknown, the petition can still be filed, but families should continue trying to obtain that information as soon as possible ([source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0)).
