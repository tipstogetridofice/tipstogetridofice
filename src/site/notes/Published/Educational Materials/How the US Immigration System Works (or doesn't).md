# How US Immigration Works
I myself am not an immigrant to the US (insofar as I was born within the US to a parent who is a US citizen by birth), and I confess that had little understanding of the US immigration system prior to starting this project and research. **While a comprehensive understanding is not required in order to help our communities against the threat of ICE, I am detailing what I have learned here as a resource for those who have questions.** 

***Knowledge is power, although it is no substitute for action.*** 
## Refugees & Refugee Status 

> [!Important Advice: Do Not Open the Door]
> ICE Officers require a judicial warrant, signed by a judge, in order to enter your property without your consent. ICE offers are going door-to-door, it's particularly important to [know your rights](https://support.iraplegalinfo.org/hc/en-us/articles/43974720166420-I-live-in-the-US-and-I-have-refugee-status-What-should-I-know#h_01KEWPBJYDCE7PB68C7606TZ19) in case ICE comes to your home ([Source: IRAP](https://support.iraplegalinfo.org/hc/en-us/articles/43974720166420-I-live-in-the-US-and-I-have-refugee-status-What-should-I-know)).

ICE may show you an administrative arrest warrant or immigration detainer, you **do not have to let them into your home.**
### Current Events 
#### Operation PARRIS
[source: IRAP](https://refugeerights.org/news-resources/u-h-a-v-bondi-challenging-the-trump-administrations-detention-of-refugees-in-minnesota)
- Also called “Operation Post-Admission Refugee Reverification and Integrity Strengthening” (“Operation PARRIS”).
	- DHS has claimed that **all refugees who have been in the country for more than one year and have not yet been granted lawful permanent resident (LPR) status** must be detained. 
	- DHS has taken this position even though refugees cannot obtain LPR status until the one-year mark after their arrival, and even though DHS itself has announced a freeze on deciding LPR applications for refugees. 
- ICE is currently focusing their efforts on **reviewing the cases of all refugees who entered the United States between January 21, 2021 and February 20, 2025**, which includes refugees who have green cards and those who have applied for green cards and are awaiting a decision.
	- Refugees have additionally been put in immigration detention. To prepare yourself or your family, I am collecting resources for safety and prep in [[Published/Direct Actions/Get Prepared/Get Prepared — Steps to Take Just In Case\|Get Prepared — Steps to Take Just In Case]]
	- All ongoing adjustment of status (or green card) applications for refugees who entered during this time period are now on “hold.” 
	- All refugees who entered during this time period will have their cases reviewed again. The purpose of this review is to confirm these individuals were correctly granted refugee status at the time of their original decisions. 
	- Some refugees who entered during this time period may be required to attend a re-interview, even though they were already interviewed before entering the United States. 
	- Lawful permanent residents (green card holders) who entered as refugees during this time period will also have their cases reviewed again and may be required to attend re-interviews. 
### What is Refugee Status? 
[source: IRAP](https://refugeerights.org/news-resources/u-h-a-v-bondi-challenging-the-trump-administrations-detention-of-refugees-in-minnesota)
**Remember: If you have refugee status, you have legal permission to be in the United States. If stopped, remain calm.**
- A refugee (according to US law) is (1) outside their country, (2) unwilling or unable to return because they have been badly harmed or fear being badly harmed due to their "race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group," and/or who meets various other specific legal requirements. 
- The UN also grants refugee status, but this does not guarantee you refugee status in the US, and US law does not necessarily apply to you if you only have UNHCR refugee status or refugee status from another country. 
- Refugee status is **not** the same thing as asylum — people who apply for immigration status from within the US are called **aslyees**. 
- People with refugee status will have one or more of the following documents indicating their status: 
	- Transportation boarding letter (brought when they entered the US by themself or the 'principle applicant' with whom they are associated) 
	- V93 Boarding Foil (if they are the follow-to-join spouse or child of a refugee who arrived before them) 
	- EAD (work permit with the category (a)(3))
	- I-94 (arrival/departure record, aka proof of legal entry into the country. Refugees will have the Class of Admission 'RE'. This form can be found on [this website](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/search/recent-search))
	- **If you don't have/can't find the above any/all of the above documents, contact an immigration attorney to ensure that you have sufficient proof of your refugee status.** 
- **Refugee status does NOT expire, and it does not need to be renewed.**
	- However, if a refugee is convicted of certain crimes or has been accused of using fake documents, they may be placed in "removal proceedings," which can result in deportation. **Have an immigration attorney on hand.** 
- Refugees hold certain benefits such as the right to work in the US, access to benefits such as food and housing, and you can apply for lawful permanent residence. 
- Refugees can travel abroad, but must obtain a rRefugee Travel Document (RTD) before leaving (Source and More Info from [the IRAP](https://support.iraplegalinfo.org/hc/en-us/articles/360056581372-I-have-refugee-or-approved-asylum-status-and-I-want-to-travel-outside-of-the-U-S)).
