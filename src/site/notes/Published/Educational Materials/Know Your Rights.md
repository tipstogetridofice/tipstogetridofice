[Source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9q47kmni28om) [En Español](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9q47kmni28om)
### When to Call 911
- You can call if **ICE is at your house, and:** 
	- You do not know who the armed people are
	- ICE refuses to show a warrant through the door
	- Officers are banging, yelling, or attempting entry
	- You fear they may break in
	- Children, elders, or vulnerable people are afraid
	- Weapons are drawn
	- Someone needs medical or mental-health help
- Calling 911 is not interfering. It is reporting a safety threat, which is fully legitimate under Minnesota law.
- You can call 911 if **you are an observer, and you can see:**
	-  Guns drawn
	- ICE attempting forced entry
	- Panic, screaming, or distress
	- Minors left alone
	- Dangerous driving, boxing in, or ramming
	- A medical or mental-health emergency
### Script for calling 9-1-1 At Home 
[Source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9q47kmni28om) [En Español](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9q47kmni28om)
“Hi, I’m inside a home/worksite. There are armed people outside claiming to be federal agents. They will not show a warrant. We are scared they may enter without authority. There are children/people inside. Can you send police to make sure everyone is safe?”
If asked:
- Do they have a warrant?  
    “They have not shown one.”
- Are you safe?  
    “No, we feel threatened.”
- Do you know who they are?  
    “They say they’re ICE, but we don’t know.”
### Script for Calling 9-1-1 As an Observer
[Source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9q47kmni28om) [En Español](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9q47kmni28om)
“Hi, I’m witnessing armed individuals at a home/worksite. The people inside seem afraid, and I’m concerned for their safety. Can you send police to monitor and ensure no one gets hurt?”
- You may describe the situation factually:
	- “They are trying to enter without showing a warrant."
	- “They say they are federal agents but I don’t know for sure.”
	- “A child is alone and crying.”
	- “Guns are out." 
- Observers must not interfere but can record from a safe public distance.**
# Know Your Rights 
[Source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9q47kmni28om) [En Español](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9q47kmni28om)
## Parental Rights & ICE 
- Read the [Center for Law and Social Policy's document](https://www.clasp.org/publications/fact-sheet/know-your-rights-parents-detained-by-ice/) on what parents detained by ICE need to know. (https://www.clasp.org/publications/fact-sheet/know-your-rights-parents-detained-by-ice/). Central takeaways: 
	- You have the right to make decisions about the care and custody of your child at the time of arrest.
	- You have the right to be kept near your child and stay in touch with them while detained.
	- You can ask for help in most detention centers to help you make plans for your children.
	- You can be part of your child’s welfare court case while you are in ICE detention.
	- You can decide whether your child will remain in the U.S. and make alternative  care arrangements.
## Is ICE Working with the Police? 
- ICE is not working with state and/or local police forces in all states. You can check your state's status [here](https://www.ice.gov/identify-and-arrest/287g) (https://www.ice.gov/identify-and-arrest/287g). 
	- By visiting that webpage and clicking the VIEW PARTICIPATING AGENCIES or VIEW PENDING AGENCIES buttons, you can also see your specific county and whether it is participating. 
	- **As of Feb., 2026, California, Oregon, Washington State, Illinois, New Jersey, and Connecticut have laws in place that restrict the federal government's ability to enact an agreement between ICE and local law enforcement.**
> The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 added Section 287(g) to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), authorizing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to delegate state and local law enforcement officers the authority to perform specified immigration officer functions under ICE’s direction and oversight ([source](https://www.ice.gov/identify-and-arrest/287g)). 
- Effectively states that ICE has the ability to deputize local and state-wide law enforcement. 
## If ICE Comes to Your Home 
[Source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9q47kmni28om) [En Español](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9q47kmni28om)
You have the strongest rights at your home. ICE often lies or pressures people into opening the door.
### Your Rights
- Do NOT open the door unless ICE shows a judicial warrant signed by a judge.  
    – ICE warrants (Forms I-200 or I-205) are NOT signed by judges and do NOT give permission to enter.
- Ask ICE to slide the warrant under the door or hold it up to a window.
- You do NOT have to let them in even if they say they just want to talk.
- Remain silent or say:  
    “I do not wish to speak with you. I do not consent to entry.”
- Do NOT sign anything.
- If ICE forces entry:  
    – Do not resist.  
    – Repeat: “I do not consent to your entry.”  
    – Use your right to remain silent.
- Important
	- Opening the door may be considered giving ICE permission to enter.
	- ICE often dresses like local police—ask:  
	- “Are you immigration agents? Are you with ICE?”**
## If ICE Stops Your Vehicle 
[Source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9q47kmni28om) [En Español](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9q47kmni28om)
ICE can approach people in or around cars, but your rights still apply.
### Your Rights
- You do NOT have to answer questions about immigration status, citizenship, or place of birth.
- You do NOT have to consent to a search of your car.  
    Say: “I do not consent to a search.”
- Keep your hands visible and stay calm.
- If you are a passenger, you can remain silent and ask if you are free to leave.
- If ICE detains you:  
    – Remain silent.  
    – Do not sign anything.  
    – Ask for a lawyer.
### ICE vs. Police (traffic stops)
- Police can ask for a driver’s license and registration.
- ICE cannot issue traffic tickets or arrest you for driving violations.
- Do NOT lie or show false documents.
## If ICE Comes to your Workplace 
[Source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9q47kmni28om) [En Español](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9q47kmni28om)
ICE may come with or without a warrant.
### Your Rights
- You do NOT have to answer questions about immigration status.
- You do NOT have to show documents unless ICE presents a judicial warrant with your name.
- You do NOT have to consent to ICE entering areas not open to the public:  
    – Kitchens  
    – Storage rooms  
    – Break rooms  
    – Back offices
- Even when working outside / at a construction site, **you do not have to answer their questions; your rights still apply.**
	- Stay calm.
	- Ask: “Am I free to leave?”
		- If yes → Walk away calmly
		- If no → Say:
			- “I choose to remain silent.”
			- “I want to speak to a lawyer.”
- DO NOT run — ICE uses that as a pretext for arrest.
- DO NOT sign anything.
### Employers
[Source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9q47kmni28om) [En Español](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9q47kmni28om)
- Employers can be shown administrative warrants (I-200/I-205).  
    These DO NOT require workers to answer questions or be detained.
- Only a judicial warrant signed by a judge allows ICE to enter private areas.
- REMEMBER: If no judicial warrant is presented, REFUSE ICE TO ENTER YOUR WORK SITE.
- Mark areas as non-public (even outside areas, such as construction sites), including construction sites, trailers, work zones, roof access areas, scaffolding, areas inside fencing or taped boundaries
- Ask ICE: “Do you have a judicial warrant signed by a judge?”
	- **Read the warrant.**
	- **If it’s administrative (I-200/I-205): “This does not give you permission to enter. I do not consent.”**
### During a workplace raid
- Stay calm.
- Ask: “Am I free to leave?”
- If yes: walk away calmly.
- If not:  
- Invoke your rights: “I want to remain silent. I want to speak to a lawyer.”  
- Do not run.  
- Do not sign anything ICE gives you.
## If/When You are Detained by ICE 
[Source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9q47kmni28om) [En Español](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9q47kmni28om)
