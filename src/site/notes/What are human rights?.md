# What are Human Rights? 
- "Human rights are standards that allow all people to live with dignity, freedom, equality, and peace" ([Source](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/Res/dhr_training_manual_2017%203.pdf), p. 12)
- "Human rights are also part of international law, contained in treaties and declarations that spell out specific rights that countries are required to uphold. Countries often incorporate human rights into their own national, state, and local laws" ([Source](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/Res/dhr_training_manual_2017%203.pdf), p. 12)
- While the US initially started a lot of the push for international human rights, we began to pull out of the agreements in the 1950s ([Source](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/Res/dhr_training_manual_2017%203.pdf), p. 28)
	- We started to venture back in in the 1960s and 70s, after the cold war, including ratifying several more treaties ([Source](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/Res/dhr_training_manual_2017%203.pdf), p. 28). 
- "Today, the United States is still not fully committed to the international human rights system. The government has yet to ratify important human rights-related treaties ... and opposes some forms of international cooperation on human rights such as the International Criminal Court" ([Source](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/Res/dhr_training_manual_2017%203.pdf), p. 29). 
- "When the United States ratifies a human rights treaty, it often adds a reservation, declaration, or understanding that restricts protection of certain rights" ([Source](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/Res/dhr_training_manual_2017%203.pdf), p. 29) 
	- Treaties might be declared "not self-executing," which "means that the treaty alone is not enforceable in domestic courts unless Congress passes legislation to implement its provisions. If the United States fails to pass the necessary legislation to uphold its international obligations, people whose treaty rights are violated have no recourse in domestic courts" ([Source](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/Res/dhr_training_manual_2017%203.pdf), p. 29) 
	- Treaties might be limited in scope, to not supersede the rights protected in the U.S. Constitution," which may be a good thing or a bad thing ([Source](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/Res/dhr_training_manual_2017%203.pdf), p. 29). 
- International Treaties the US has ratified ([Source](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/Res/dhr_training_manual_2017%203.pdf), p. 30)
