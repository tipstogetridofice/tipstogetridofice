### Helping a Detainee 
- Detainees should appear on [this website](https://locator.ice.gov/odls/#/search)— although attorneys report that some detainees have never appeared or take a long time to appear in this database. 
- In Minnesota: 
	- If someone has just been detained by ICE and has not yet been transferred to Whipple or out of Minnesota, there is a narrow window to act. **Whether a family member, Next Friend, or attorney is contacted first, the following information should be gathered as quickly as possible to allow immediate habeas filing ([source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0)):
		- Full legal name
		- Date of birth
		- Alien number (A-Number), if known
		- Immigration history (especially confirmation of no final removal order)
		- City of residence in Minnesota
		- Location, date, and time of arrest
		- Current detention location (if known) — for example, local holding facility, Whipple, or ICE processing site
		- Phone number of a family member or trusted contact
		- Name and status (U.S. citizen or LPR) of the Next Friend
- A detained US Citizen: US citizens are typically processed separately from those of different immigration status — most often, they are **released within a few hours.** Calling the NLG hotline is still recommended: **612-444-2654** ([source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0))
- Fill this out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfyLbgmgaJIXaiOkDD_vgm9cO6Xm0taaiqAWQjwvnax5xCIow/viewform?pli=1), if applicable (see instructions) on behalf of the detainee (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfyLbgmgaJIXaiOkDD_vgm9cO6Xm0taaiqAWQjwvnax5xCIow/viewform?pli=1)
- A detained Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR): loved ones should immediately complete the Habeas Project intake form, which mobilizes lawyers, legal workers, and law students to file habeas petitions quickly. ([source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0))

([source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0))
- Detainees of other immigrant statuses: Call the National Lawyers Guilde hotline **612-444-2654** and file a **habeas petition** ([source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0)). 
- **Call this network of volunteer attorneys.** They’ve set up a hotline for loved ones to call, ideally as soon as people are abducted, to provide us with the info we need (the detained individual’s full name, DOB, A number (if applicable), etc.). The faster they can connect with loved ones after an abduction, the better. They have an intake team and interpreters who will get back to people as soon as possible. **The number is 1-833-511-4766** ([source](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnacBDU1KBefoBekQRNvENwg3BdLVT12me1m7ZgEQOY/edit?tab=t.0)).
