# ICE Factsheet 
Resources on reported tactics, your rights, and how to keep yourself safe from ICE
- If you are an immigrant, [check your case status](https://egov.uscis.gov/). 
- **ICE is currently going door-to-door**, targeting immigrants (even those with lawful refugee status). 
- Detainees are frequently **moved** after their arrest, often to **Texas**. 
	- They are likely to sustain inhumane conditions. 
	- This includes children & the elderly. 
- ICE officers are working with local law enforcement in some cases; be wary of police. 
- ICE may approach you in your vehicle, at work, and at home. 
	- At home and in your vehicle, the Constitution states that you **do not have to let ICE inside unless they have a *judicial* warrant** signed by a judge. 
		- ICE has been known to present *administrative* warrants, which are not signed by a judge. 
	- However, **ICE officers have been known to resort to violence** (see [[Aliya Rahman's Testimony\|Aliya Rahman's Testimony]]) and may **approach you with guns and/or a knife.**
		- **Remain calm, follow ICE's instructions as best as you can.***
- **Detainees** are often shipped out of Minnesota / their home state and to detention centers in Texas or Louisiana ([Source 1](https://sahanjournal.com/immigration/ice-detainees-stranded-after-release/?utm_source=Sahan+Journal+newsletter&utm_campaign=a57248a196-Sahan+Sunday_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_-4785ce0c9c-633894526&mc_cid=a57248a196)).
