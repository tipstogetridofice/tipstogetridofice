# How to File a Case with the IACHR
- Use this **[online form](http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/)** to file a complaint. 
- "An individual, group, or nongovernmental organization may file a petition with the IACHR with information about the petitioner and the human rights violations" ([Source](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/Res/dhr_training_manual_2017%203.pdf), p. 24) 
- Before filing with the IACHR, "advocates should first determine whether the government violated any of the rights in the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man" ([Source](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/Res/dhr_training_manual_2017%203.pdf), p. 24)
	- The IACHR keeps extensive info about that treaty on its [website](http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/).
	- "Advocates should also consider whether the individual bringing the complaint (the petitioner) has exhausted all options in domestic courts" ([Source](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/Res/dhr_training_manual_2017%203.pdf), p. 24).
- "While the IACHR does not have the power to order or compel U.S. compliance, petitions to the IACHR can be used strategically to: 1) allow for new arguments to be considered that may be barred from consideration in federal or state court for procedural reasons; 2) allow more time to negotiate domestic remedies pending IACHR review; 3) generate important publicity on the international stage relative to the issues in the case, and 4) provide an opportunity for a survivor of human rights abuses to be heard" ([Source](https://www.theadvocatesforhumanrights.org/Res/dhr_training_manual_2017%203.pdf), p. 24)
